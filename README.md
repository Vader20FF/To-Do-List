# A Simple To-Do List iOS app with DataCore database

# List of things I have learnt during the work on this app:

- Basic use of **DataCore** database objects and their attributes along with modifying them
- Working with **dates**
- **Localization** of the app (polish, english)
- Changing **Views**
- Making the app reactive to color scheme change (**light / dark mode**)


# The user can:

- Add the task, modify and delete it
- Mark task as finished either by clicking the dot next to task title or checking finished state in edit view
- Change light / dark mode
